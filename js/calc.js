/**
 * Function to calculate the detailed loan schedule with support for part payments. 
 *
 * @param {number} loanAmount - The initial amount of the loan. This is the principal amount that the loan was issued for. 
 * @param {number} yearlyInterest - The yearly interest rate as a percentage (e.g., for 5%, pass 5).
 * @param {number} months - The total number of months for which the loan was issued.
 * @param {string} [partPaymentFrequency="off"] - The frequency of part payments. This can be 'off', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'yearly', or 'custom'.
 *                                              If 'off', part payments will not be considered in the calculations.
 *                                              If 'monthly', 'quarterly', or 'yearly', part payments will be made every month, every 3 months, or every 12 months respectively, using the value of the partPayment parameter.
 *                                              If 'custom', the function will expect a customPartPaymentSchedule array, with each object in the array specifying the installment number and part payment amount.
 * @param {number} [partPayment=0] - The amount of part payment. This will be used if the partPaymentFrequency is set to 'monthly', 'quarterly', or 'yearly'.
 * @param {Date} [startDate=new Date()] - The date of the first installment. The function will calculate the dates of subsequent installments by adding a month to this date for each installment.
 * @param {Object[]} [customPartPaymentSchedule=[]] - Array of custom part payment objects, each containing the installment number and part payment amount.
 *                                                   This will be used if partPaymentFrequency is set to 'custom'.
 *                                                   Each object in the array should be in the following format: { "installmentNumber": x, "partPayment": y }, where x is the installment number and y is the part payment amount for that installment.
 *
 * @returns {Object} An object containing the loan schedule as an array of objects and the total amounts of part payments made, interest paid, money saved by making part payments, monthly installment to be paid, and total amount paid.
 *                   Each object in the schedule array contains detailed information about each installment, including the installment number and date, opening balance, principal, interest, total payment, part payment, total payment including part payment, closing balance, and loan paid till today as a percentage.
 *
 * Note: All monetary amounts in the output are formatted as strings in the 'en-US' locale and 'USD' currency.
 *       To change the locale or currency, modify the 'toAmount' helper function inside this function.
